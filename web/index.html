    <h1>Maquette demo</h1>
    <h2>"Hero transitions"</h2>
    <p>
      The term 'hero-transition' was coined by the Polymer project. They describe it as: 
      <i>'hero-transition' transforms two elements in different pages such that they appear
      to be shared across the pages</i> (<a href="https://github.com/Polymer/core-animated-pages/blob/master/transitions/hero-transition.html">Source</a>). 
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the important aspects of <a href="http://maquettejs.org">maquette</a> is animations. So is maquette also able to perform hero-transitions?
      Maquette has support for both disappearing and appearing elements. But in order to perform a hero transition, we need to be able to match a
      'hero' element in a disappearing element to a 'hero' element in an appearing element. 
    </p>
    <p>
      For this demonstration we added created a hero-manager object that is able to do just that. 
      The hero-manager is hooked up to the normal enter and exit animations and to the afterUpdate callback.
